Following are the specific objectives that the course aims to fulfil: (a) Introduction to the science of food; (b) Exposition to culinary data; (c) Analysis and visualization of culinary data (statistical analysis; text mining; natural language processing; machine learning);(d) Exposure to challenges and opportunities.,,,,,,,,,
Discrete Mathematics,CSE121,Discrete Mathematics is the study of mathematical structures (objects) which are discrete; distinct in nature. This course provides the mathematical basis for the understanding of computers and modern computation. It is the backbone of computer science and has a lot of applications in cryptography and engineering.,,,,,,,,,
Narratives in Visual Communication,DES504,Narratives are used in design as a technique to get insight into users; build empathy and access them emotionally. With stories; designers speak to increase the appeal of what they offer and provide a solid understanding of the users. For eg.; UX designers typically tell on-screen stories; weaving narratives to make users invest their emotions in our messages. Designers aim to engage users through their feelings; as opposed to describing design of the product or system from a functionalist/task-oriented viewpoint. An effective user experience depends on the success of users’ achieving their goals ‘usability-wise’. However; storytelling is the framework used by designers to reach users. The world can be experienced through metaphors; not bullet-point specifications; storytelling is the best way to relate to audiences. Effective storytelling means going beyond getting users emotionally invested; to keeping them engaged after their experiences; too; so they attach more meaning to designed products/services.Sketching/Drawing is used as medium both to form a conceptual understanding and execution of narrative as a tool of communication. Sketching/Drawing in Visual Commuication is a fundamental tool for Narratives; which is not limited to using the analogus pencil on paper or the digital tablet and pen. It is an activity that involves observation; visualisation and storytelling.,,,,,,,,,
Design Drawing & Visualization,DES101,DESIGN DRAWINGBased on the premise that drawing is central to the design process this course focuses on drawing as a medium for observing; representing; conceptualizing; visualizing and communicating design ideas. The emphasis is on drawing by hand; which is the most direct and intuitive means we have to express our visual thoughts and perceptions. In direct response to our visual thoughts and perceptions; we develop an understanding of spatial concepts and the critical ability to think and visualize in three dimensions through the tactile nature of drawing.This course fosters understanding of drawing and sketching as a means to develop observational skills through the study of the environment and as a tool for visual representation; ideation/conceptualization; visualization and communication or presentation of design ideas through sketching and drawing from both observation and memory.VISUALIZATION DRAWINGVisualization is an act of thought or reflection. In design; we speculate and visualize what might be possible in the future. Drawing gives material existence to our conceptions so that they can be seen; assessed; and acted upon. The drawing out of these ideas; whether executed quickly or slowly; roughly or carefully; is necessarily speculative in nature. We can never determine beforehand precisely what the final outcome will be. The developing image on paper gradually takes on a life of its own and guides the exploration of a concept as it travels between mind and paper and back again. Drawing from the imagination addresses issues that arise as we think in a speculative manner to stimulate the design process; develop our design ideas through drawing; and plan how to present our design proposals in the best possible light. This course gives the students an overview of the generative and developmental stages of the design process and drawing as distinctly speculative in nature. Thoughts develop as a drawing progress; which can alter perceptions and suggest possibilities not yet conceived.,,,,,,,,,
Design Processes and Perspectives,DES201,This course introduces students to the theoretical and practical aspects of design evolving processes.

Such data is mostly operational business data (e.g. sales, accounting, payroll, inventory), and has been the mainstay of database systems since their inception. Enterprises have gathered this information (based on the view defined) from multiple data sources and stored it in a central repository, called data warehousing, for decision support functionalities and data analysis. This kind of analysis is best-suited when the support for decision making is based on the historical or point-in-time view of the business, not on a (near) real-time view and/or knowledge. Since the “structured” data constitutes only a fraction of the entire information content within an enterprise, which also includes “unstructured” content like reports, email, meeting minutes, web-pages etc, the enterprises are now realizing to integrate their entire information sources across structured and unstructured data sources.

Theories of Ethics,SSH300,"The history of Ethics in the western philosophical tradition has witnessed a fundamental shift in its set of concerns and its basic approach in modernity that marks a ‘decisive break’ in relation to its point of departure in ancient Greek thought. This shift, broadly characterized, consists in moving from the question of what constitutes a ‘good life’—one that is conducive to the fullest realization of human potentiality, to what constitutes ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ action. This course will articulate and analyse the major ethical theories and approaches in the Western tradition in light of this shift. Such a broad historical perspective would allow students to apprehend why for instance, the preoccupation with the ‘Good’ gives rise to ethics of a particular ‘shape’, namely, ‘virtue ethics’; whereas the questions of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’, along with the procedural mode of their determination, emerge in the context of Enlightenment modernity, and the ‘disenchantment of nature’ that it brings in its wake. If ethics, under conditions of modernity, is compelled to take a more procedural form, as a reaction to ethical scepticism and the evisceration of ‘ethical content’ that the deracination of God from nature, hence of purposiveness in nature, entails, then the issue of what remains of the ‘old’ in the ‘new’, of the ancient in the modern, also surfaces. These themes would be pursued in different modalities, by raising, for instance, the problematic of the (privileged) ontological status of the ‘human’ (as opposed to the ‘animal’), in the modern discourse on ‘Human rights’ and environmental ethics.",,,,,,,,,

Program Verification,CSE584,"Program verification is proving the correctness of programs with respect to certain properties. It is useful for proving absence of bugs in a program, or for checking that arbitrary assertions (properties) hold without even executing the program. These techniques have been successfully applied to problems such as proving network protocols, cryptographic protocols, hardware, algorithms, and safety-critical systems. There have been recent techniques toward making program verification practical for general-purpose programs, and this course will focus on these techniques. In most of these techniques, programmers provide richer types for variables and functions which are sufficient to mathematically prove their properties of interest. This may look like providing extra infomation with types (e.g. specifying that a variable x is of type int but also greater than 3 and an even number, or specifying a variable y can be an integer or a string depending on if another variable x is negative or positive). Afterwards, the programmer writes their assertion and a proof of that assertion in an IDE-like envrionment, which can often automatically complete large parts of the proof for you. The course will look at the language Coq, a mature dependent typed functional programming language which has been used to prove program correctness of various programs since a few decades, and F*: a newer functional programming language by Inria and Microsoft Research with programming verification goal and with more features for general-purpose programs.

Software Defined Networking,CSE565,Traditionally; networking equipments consists of proprietary switching hardware with embedded software. This not only made manageability of networks complex but also stymied innovation. SDN paradigm proposed to change this; primarily by separating networking software into data and control planes. The data plane’s goal is to do switching in distributed hardware equipments. The control plane centrally governs what will be the switching rules at the data plane. As the control plane is separated from the switching hardware; it is easier to change its software; thereby speeding up software development cycle and in turn lowering the barrier for innovation. The separation of planes and centralization of control plane simplifies manageability of networks.

Meta-Learning,CSE663A,"Meta-Learning' or 'learning to learn' refers to the problem of developing machine learning/deep learning models that can adapt to new tasks/domains/environments, either very ""rapidly"", i.e., requiring very little new data/experience, or in a manner robust to distributional shifts, such as when users change their behaviour, as has been experienced across the board due to the pandemic. Both scenarios are also closely related, since distributional shifts also imply the relative scarcity of 'new' data, with practical considerations making it imperative to rapidly adapt to every 'new normal'. Meta-learning is also closely related to two long-desired goals of AI in general, viz., continual learning (without forgetting) and learning higher-level (and ideally causal) representations that allow for better generalisation, e.g. to deal with non-stationarity or for longer duration forecasting etc.

Using data for SE has been around for quite some time (e.g. Mining Software Repositories is an area that focuses on getting knowledge from the data.)

Film Making and Radio Podcasting,DES303,"You cannot be a good film maker if you don’t know how to edit audio sound track and video film footage. One of the worlds greatest film maker Eisenstein stated: ""Cinematography is; first and foremost; montage."" Eisenstein believed that film montage could create ideas or have an impact beyond the individual images. Two or more images edited together create a ""tertium quid"" (third thing) that makes the whole greater than the sum of its individual parts. Similarly Alfred Hitchcock said “For me; cinema is essentially emotion. It is pieces of film joined together that create an idea; which in turn creates an emotion in the mind of the audience. Not through spoken words; but through the visuals. It's a visual medium. And montage is the main thing. All moviemaking is pure montage."" It is believed by some that good films are made more on the editing table.

Positive Psychology,PSY202,“Happiness is not an end state; but rather something you work towards your whole life. Thus; you can be happier each day. Even happiness is a journey; not a destination.”- Martin SeligmanIn this course students will not only study but actually imbibe this journey.The mentioned course would be based on the key concepts of Positive Psychology; its principles; concepts and experiential practices. The course focuses on the psychological aspects of a fulfilling and flourishing life. Topics include happiness; self-esteem; empathy; friendship; love; achievement; creativity; optimism; conflict resolution; gratitude; positive leadership; hypnosis; mindfulness; meditation and humor.Positive psychology is “the scientific study of optimal human functioning” and was first introduced as a field of study by Dr. Martin Seligman in 1998; when he was President of the American Psychological Association.The underlying premise of positive psychology is that you can learn to be happier just as you can learn a foreign language or to be proficient at golf. This rapidly growing field is shedding light on what makes us happy; the pursuit of happiness; and how we can lead more fulfilling; satisfying lives. As Martin Seligman states that it is the Science of Positive Psychology that would help the individual to study the self and the society and to help him realize his maximum potential; with which he would be able to lead a happier personal; academic; social and professional life.This course is designed to explore the concepts; research behind the concepts; techniques; factors and exercises to enhance optimism; decrease stressors; and significantly increase wellbeing. The format of the course will be experiential; workshop based and interactive along with assigned lectures and readings to create an environment conducive to learning new concepts; skills and applications.,,,,,,,,,
Cognitive Psychology,PSY301,In this introductory course we investigate the mechanisms of human thinking. Particularly we will explore the basic mental processes such as how our brains let us “view” and “understand” the world; how our perceptions depend on our current state of attention; and how our memories and perceptions can change over time with our own experiences. In this process of better understanding the human mind; we’ll discuss language abilities and the mental representation of concepts and schemas. We’ll also look at various actions that people take in different situations—from simple visual illusions; to strategic higher order decisions to grave mistakes in higher-level decision-making. In this context we will discuss how these “successes” and “failures” provide unique insights into the mechanisms of human thinking.,,,,,,,,,
Social Psychology,PSY302,"The course is an exploration of the prevailing theories, topics and empirical methods in the study of Social Psychology. It will specifically focus on five main areas: (1) the science of Social Psychology and its theoretical foundations, (2)research methods used in Social Psychology research, (3) the individual in context to the social world, (4) an individual's impact on another individual or group/s, and (5) The dynamics of social relationships.",,,,,,,,,

Learning and Memory,PSY306/506,"The course will introduce the students to the stages and mechanisms by which environmental information is learned;how it flows from sensory receptors through sensory, short- term to long-term memory, its storage and retrieval. Lectures and discussions will draw from published scientific evidence mainly in the areas of behaviour, neuroimaging and neurophysiology to elucidate the organization and implementation of memory in the brain that influences various aspects of human cognition. An additional component will involve computational analysis of experimental datasets in this field to draw brain-behaviour inferences pertaining to learning and memory. The course will engage students to develop analytical thinking based on experimental data towards building capacity for original ideation in this area of cognitive science that is relatable to science and technology.",,,,,,,,,
Cognition of Motor Movement,PSY308/508,"Motor movement corresponds to various kinds of movement that we execute in everyday life like hand movements (reaching, grasping), eye movements, walking etc. A comprehensive understanding of human motor system would help in engineering better tools, systems, robots, neuroprosthetics etc. This course work is designed to start with the introduction to the human motor system, different types of action or movement like; grasping, reaching, spatial navigation, eye-movement etc. This will be followed by understanding of the mechanics, neurophysiology and psychology of action planning and execution.",,,,,,,,,
Introduction to Sociology and Anthropology,SOC101,"This course will introduce learners to the basic nature of society and its impact on an individual through the lens of Sociology and Anthropology. It will focus on some foundational sociological/anthropological concepts such as social structure, environment, social organization, social institutions, social role, social relations, social change and social problems. All these key terms would be examined with reference to modern social theories and methods, which barely 200 years ago, helped shape sociology and anthropology as unique human disciplines. Historically, both these disciplines were distinct from the earlier disciplines of economics, philosophy and psychology because they directly confronted data from social life and collective social processes in the ‘field’, in order to critically analyze, and discover patterns and meanings in them. The enormous diversity of people around the globe could thus be organized conceptually and theoretically through statistical surveys, questionnaires and interviews, not only to make sense of the basic oneness of humanity but also to shape policies and programmes to help improve the fast deteriorating social conditions under modern urban and industrialised ways of life. The irreducible subject matter and unit of study for sociology and anthropology therefore was neither the abstract atomized individual nor the crowd but the empirical relationship between the individual and his/her social context which had to be unearthed and examined afresh by the scholar without getting misled by more obvious, subjective explanations. Students of the course will be led through a variety of experiences of observable social phenomena such as caste, class, gender, race, sexuality, religion, globalization, poverty, crime, work and many such others, in order to arrive at the basic scientific principles of society.",,,,,,,,,
Contemporary India: Sociological Perspective,SOC202,"This course will systematically familiarize students with some of the important vignettes of a complex and highly diverse country–India. Using a historically contextualized approach to understand the shaping of ‘contemporary’, this course will provide an overview of the functioning and transformation of India in the face of global social change. Grounded in sociology but drawing upon recent developments in the other social sciences as well, this course will critically examine the transformations in India’s social, cultural, political, economic and technological realms and will critically interrogate the developmental issues and fault lines facing Indian society both from the vantage point of contemporary and indigenous sociological theory.",,,,,,,,,
Sociology of New Media,SOC204,"This course is aimed introducing students to macro-sociological concepts to understand the role of new media and online networking in the contemporary world. (In PART I) we draw from sociological perspectives that move beyond ‘technological determinism’ and shed light on the social and real-world implications of IT-driven media and communications. We begin with a survey of key concepts, including the theories of networks by Barry Wellman (2012), Manuel Castells (1996) and others who conceptualised the rise of ‘new’ media and online communicationsas as central to ongoing social change. (In Part II) We consider a series of thematic areas and evaluate these theories in the context of contemporary socieities. These themes range from the rising inequality and digital divide, to the role of new media in politics and power and also in the related fields of journalism and law. In terms of pedagogical approach, and evaluating criteria, our course will rely on active learning that requires all students to participate and engage with online communities as well as reflect on the key concepts through their own experience as social media users in India.",,,,,,,,,
Anthropology and Social Media,SOC205,"When we hear the words 'social media' we immediately think of Facebook and Twitter, WhatsApp and Instagram. But these are just platforms. Actually, Social media is the vast amount of content we have produced and its consequences for our lives. The content we produce are not just memes and selfies alone, but they are also tools for making and breaking relationships, a means for creating equality and/or reinforcing inequality. While there have been grand claims made about how social media has impacted the lives of people around the world, we often fail to ask is it really likely that social media has changed the life of a low-income builder in Brazil in exactly the same way as it has for an IT professional in South India or that of a factory worker in China? Consider this claim... social media is a sort of big brother that knows all our intimate details and we have lost our rights to privacy. While it is true for some, it is equally true that social media is also the first-time people experience privacy. For e.g. In China, for some people far from being a threat to their privacy, social media was actually the very first time they had experienced what we would call individual privacy. This was true in Turkey as well. Similarly, while it is true that while some might view social media as a distraction to education, it is equally true that for a few others social media is itself education. Likewise, for some the Selfie is more about expressing friendship rather than individual glamour, thus subverting the notion of individualism. How do we know this? Why do people see the same phenomenon differently? While it is important to understand ‘what’ content we produce, the question of why we produce such content is equally significant. This course meant as an introductory course is about ‘people’ and an attempt at understanding the affinities, connectedness, and reciprocities that social media builds. The course will also introduce ethnographic ways and means to study works of anthropologically informed social media cultures. The course would also focus on ontologies of media anthropology and specific texts that are produced through online ethnographies This course invites you to come and see for yourselves what people around the world do with social media.

Business Anthropology,SOC206,"How did experiences of sleeping in strangers’ homes lead to the creation of one of the world’s most successful online hospitality company - Airbnb? How did the idea of public space influence and lead to the creation of the world’s most successful coffee company - Starbucks? How does Youtube, the most significant pool of social and cultural data since the beginning of recorded communication use it to reveal more about us, humans and the society we live? Why do people buy what they buy? Do Malls have a hold on the consumers? Does Coca-Cola have the same meaning in all cultures? How does advertising influence your decision to buy? Do people buy products which speak to their cultural values? How is culture tied to consumption? How do companies mine your social media and online data for understanding your consumption patterns? Does Wall Street have its own culture? How does working in virtual teams affect the work culture and productivity of people? How do employees make use of organizational technology to shape Organizational culture? Does the idea of ‘Tribal Leadership’ by Zappos founder Tony Hsieh influence employees? All the above factors have cultural influences more than what we tend to acknowledge. In the recent past corporations have started using ethnography and anthropology to gain insights into marketing and organizations strategically. Exploring and deconstructing such cultural and social influences through both fieldwork and case studies (text and videos) with a sprinkling of anthropological theories is the primary intent of this course.",,,,,,,,,
Organizations An Anthropological Perspective,SOC208,"Where would you like to work? Imagine coming to IIITD or any such institution where you find your batch mates, professors and others being excited about their work. Discussions are all around the next thing that's going to change the world, the atmosphere is vibrant, lively and exciting. People are proud of their work. You see people work together, solve problems together, set standards, share ideas on how to improve performance and value diversity. You are given an opportunity to rise and shine. Now imagine the same place being very toxic, where people are very insecure, secretive, highly competitive with no cooperation etc. or a place where both of these co-exist…a sort of a hybrid So, where would you like to be? We live in a world which is more or less organized. We live most of our lives within organizations and sometimes amongst them. We grow and live in families and kin groups of different sorts, study in educational institutions, work for firms or public agencies of different sizes and shapes, join clubs, service organizations etc. and infact, if we take a moment to reflect, we would understand that a large part of our lives have been shaped by organizations. Now, getting back to the earlier question…while everyone wants to work for an ideal organisation where you have opportunities to rise and shine and come to work/study everyday in a pleasant setting…achieving this kind of a cultural setting is every leader’s dream and is easier said than done. Managing and setting ideals to create such a work culture requires understanding the various factors (both internal and external) that affect the organisation. Social and cultural influences do play a significant role more than what we tend to acknowledge. In the recent past corporations have started using ethnography and anthropology to gain insights into managing organizations strategically. Exploring and deconstructing such cultural and social influences through both fieldwork and case studies (text and videos) with a sprinkling of anthropological theories is the primary intent of this course.",,,,,,,,,
Consumer Culture and Society,SOC209,"Rising consumption levels is a key aspect of contemporary societies. “We live in a consumer society” is a phrase we come across very often. This statement points towards the disproportionate significance of material possessions, consumer goods and services in modern societies and the power of money to “buy it all”. Right from the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the cars we drive, the media we consume, the technologies we use and the health and educational services we get, consumption pervades our everyday lives and practices. Is shopping only a frivolous activity? Do people claim identities through commodities? What is modern consumption based on- needs or wants? The course on Consumer Culture and Society will make students re-think of themselves less as citizens and more as consumers. Emphasis in this course will be on understanding consumption practices by embedding them within their social, cultural, and economic contexts. Both the positive and negative impacts of consumerism on individuals and societies will be interrogated. Lectures will be complimented through field-based activities where students will examine consumption places and spaces (shopping malls, local markets, advertisements and e-stores) to understand what all (in addition to the actual product) is being sold – an image, a lifestyle, a status symbol, a body type, modernity etc.. Using specific consumption domains like food, fashion, media/entertainment technology and intimate relations the course will make the learners engage with ideas of liberation, choice, identity, status, inequality, lifestyle, freedom, signification, and power. Further, critiques of consumerism and their linkages with ‘big issues’ of consumer protests and environmental degradation will also be discussed.",,,,,,,,,
Sociological Theory,SOC210,"Sociology is a fundamental social science that builds an understanding of the dynamics of an increasingly complex world. As a discipline it fosters an understanding not merely of the social element of human life but of how economic, social and political arrangements intersect to create and transform institutions, groups and communities of which we are a part. To that end a fundamental course in Sociological Theory will build an understanding on some of the big questions we confront today- globalisation, the entrenchement of information technology in our lives , the rise of social inequalities and an increased concern for the environment. The course will do this by turning to classical sociological theories that offer us an ‘epic theory’ to understand the development of the modern world. The second half of the course will focus on contemporary issues and theories tracing their links to and away from the classical approaches. A study of theory of theory will allow students to critically analyse the development of values and institutions that have been the foundation of modern society both in India and across the world.",,,,,,,,,
"Science, Technology and Society",SOC211,This course introduces students to the sociology of science and technology (STS). It engages with ideas that question pure science as value-neutral theory that hold the potential to reveal an existing empirical reality. This idea further destablises the distinction between science as theory and technology as its application; by exploring the various methods through which science and technology construct truths about the world. The course asks a crucial and fundamental question— what is science and technology? Is science the theory of the natural world and technology the material artefact that emerges through scientific principles? Or are science and technology embedded in webs of social relations? Or are science and technology developed through the values that drive it: including ideas of growth; development; efficiency; reducing human labour and conquering the natural world.The course will study science; technology and society as continuous domains; which will allow students to explore different perspectives on science that question the taken for granted-ness of reality; by paying attention to the social processes of knowledge making. Further the course will encourage students to study the social circumstances of developing newer technologies by thinking about the use and effect of technology on society. This will promote critical thinking about technology: how are technologies compatible with particular political systems; what are its effects on existing power structures; how does it relate to systems of governing; and finally how does it impact ecology or raise concerns of sustainability.While the course does not focus on a particular technology; because it is explores more fundamental ideas of technology and its relation to science and society; the tutorials and evaluation will be based on case studies from Biotechnology; Nanotechnology; Robotics; Cognitive Sciences and Artificial Intelligence. In examining case studies of these technologies; the course will introduce students to criteria for understanding and evaluating the above technologies. In doing so; sociological perspectives are brought to the study of science and technology; in order to question the conceptual divide between science as theory; technology as its application and society as unrelated to them.,,,,,,,,,
Key Concepts in Economic Sociology,SOC212,Traditional economic analysis takes the rational individual as its starting point. Economic Sociology on the other hand encourages students to see rational self-interest and action as embedded in society; influenced by group dynamics; legal institutions; power; organizations and even culture. It justifies the application of independent sociological methods and concepts to the examination and understanding of the Economy as a sphere of production; consumption and exchange of goods and services; which is observable in all human societies; not only the modern and advanced. It thereby encourages students to relate economic actions to all other forms of social actions observable in society – the religious; the familial; the technological and the political. In sum; Economic sociology identifies the obligatory; symbolic and power seeking motivations underlying human economic action; not only the useful or utilitarian.Thic Course provides students with a corrective perspective. It re-ignites awareness of fundamental questions and looks to the contributions of thinkers like Karl Polanyi; Marcell Mauss and Granovetter and Swedberg to reconsider our assumptions on how we produce;consume and exchange; and live.,,,,,,,,,

Introduction to Digital Ethnography,SOC213,"This course is intended to be an introductory course and will systematically introduce learners to the basics of Digital Ethnography. The course will first introduce learners to the fundamentals of Ethnography as a research method and will then help facilitate its application to the Digital world. The course will use a combination of lectures and case studies to showcase how Digital Ethnography was used to discover significant nuggets of information that was then used to uncover larger trends. To enhance learning, the student is encouraged to bring his/her laptop and smart phone(s) to the class.",,,,,,,,,
Urban Sociology,SOC302,"What is a city? Why is technological advancement/innovation associated with cities? Who belongs to a city? How is a city different from a countryside? Why is urban life coveted? Does Paris in France have an old city area like many Indian cities have? What makes each city different yet similar? Is everyone’s experience of living in the city the same? Urban Sociology studies the relationship between city, its institutions, its space and its people. Over the course of this semester, this course will look at (i) cities, their origin and evolution; (ii) the nature and character of cities (iii) how technology has shaped urban landscape and urban social relations; (iv) conflicts and contestations that characterise life in city; and (v) the future of cities in a digital, global age. The course will familiarise students with the macro and micro forces shaping the urban landscape and social relations. The course through a combination of lectures, case studies and activities will highlight challenges and opportunities associated with cities in a bid to encourage application of students’ technological knowledge in a sociologically relevant and socially viable manner to address urban phenomena and urban challenges. The course will broadly cover themes like urbanism, urbanisation, suburbanisation, peri-urbanisation, gentrification, slums, urban villages, segregation and inequality, right to the city, smart cities, digital technology and cities. At the culmination of this course students will broadly be familiar with ideas and debates in urban sociology.",,,,,,,,,
Digital Social Research,SOC307,"With the digital social data growing at an accelerated pace on an everyday basis, there is an urgent need for social researchers to decrypt, examine and interpret this unusually large-scale complex data fill. Doing this systemically will not only help in deciphering and understanding the social world we live in but will also help strategically combat the complex challenges of the contemporary social world. With a growing demand for such skills both in the academic and the commercial sectors, this course anchored in sociology and anthropology will provide the learners to a methodological rigour steeped in theoretical underpinnings from both these fields. Through empirical approaches suited specifically for the digital data, this course will provide the learners an opportunity to effectively engage not only in identifying interesting issues to study, but also with framing valid research questions, formulating an effective research design, sampling, data collection methods and tools, quantitative/qualitative and mixed methods analyses of the collected data and the necessary theoretical interpretation of the results. The course also aims to provide its learners an objective view of social data issues viz. reliability, replicability, reproducibility, validity and generalizability of the data and the associated methods. It will also introduce the learners to ethical implications associated with conducting digital social research.",,,,,,,,,
Gender and Media,SOC308/SOC514,"Everyone around us is talking about the TV show Game of Thrones (GoT), isn’t it? But ever wondered that in GoT, land and titles are being passed in the male bloodline while the women are married off for political reasons and alliances? The former are mostly depicted as violent, muscular, powerful and aggressive while the latter as being submissive, dependent, innocent and sexualised. In varying forms and degrees these characterisations are replicated across various media platforms. Drawing primarily from sociology and supporting literature from media studies, cultural studies, feminist theory, and internet/new media studies, the course on gender and media will introduce students to mediated construction and presentations of gender through engagement with representations of masculinity, femininity and sexualities, and their intersectionality with class, race, ethnicity and caste, in print and electronic media.

Philosophy of Mind,SSH324,"What is the nature of mind/consciousness - is it immaterial or material, or both? How do we understand the relation between the mind, brain and the body on the one hand, and the mind and the external world, on the other? What is it to have a mental representation or a 'thought'? Are such mental representations, intentional states, and 'experiencing' itself (such as experiencing pain) inseparable from self-consiousness, such that without self-consciousness there can be no consciousness? Can 'thinking' be processively or functionally reproduced in computers? Is the possibility of such reproduction essential to fully grasping what the mind is?

In the first part we conceptualize the idea of power and knowledge through a variety of perspectives, ranging from the Hayek-ian and Marxist appraoch, as well as the widely accepted middle ground of Weberian view on knowledge, big data and its implication in politics. Towards the end of the section I, we move away from the meta-theory to adopt a more infra-theory approach and introduce students to critical framework drawn from the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS) which can help us conceptualize ‘the digital’ in its historical and non-Western context. In the second part of the course we consider the role of 'the digital' in relation to politics of power and resistance in various countries, adding a comparative dimension to theories of digital technology. Beginning with the West and the US in particular, we move to China, Africa and finally, India. In each case, we read analytical and empirical literature that focusses on the
assemblage of digital media, technology and social change with a focus on Foucaldian perspectives on knowledge/power, data and surveillance technologies in politics.

New Media and Politics,SSH323,"Conventional views on the global rise of populism, fake news and extreme polarisation evaluate these in terms of the 'the failure of the neoliberal economics' and/or a result of 'destabilised cultural identity'. But could this have happened without the Internet? This course offers a 'new' media perspective to answer this puzzle, and combines varied explanations to develop macro- level theoretical insights around contemporary politics and implications for policy and regulation. (In PART I) we begin by questioning the binaries in debates around 'hacktivism' which either ignore the difference between old and new media or adopts a heavy ‘technological determinism’ in their explanations. Instead, we develop arguments around the newness of Internet-enabled political action, covering key and historical and technological development relating to spatial nature of new populism ('counter public sphere' Fraser 1992), social movements (Wellman and Raini 2012) as well as communicative power (Castells 2009). (In PART II) we consider several prominent case studies and examples to evaluate these theoretical and conceptual insights. We begin with the 'occupy' movements that spread across the world after the financial crisis in early 2010s, and then analyse the use of new media in the uprisings in Arab world and Asia. Taking a series of case studies we theorise the power of Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp as 'new' intermediaries and analyse the populist trend in terms of the changing balance between the state and society and the slow erosion of established institutions. These cases focus primarily on populist politics but also include new environmental movements, civic activism and digital journalism. In terms of pedagogical approach, and evaluating criteria, our course will rely on active learning that requires all students to develop a strong research orientation and would help them devlop independent projects that showcase these insights in terms of policy analysis, journalism as well as technology development.",,,,,,,,,

Visual Design & Communication,DES202,"VISUAL DESIGN: Based on the premise that Visual Design is a discipline of design that applies the principles of visual language for better analysis and understanding of design problem and solution, this course focuses on the elements and principles of the visual language and their semantic use. A multi- disciplinary domain, design consists of, aesthetics, architecture, products, communication, processes, systems, technology, business/commerce, ramification on environment and society and demands clear understanding of design fundamentals. Apart from the thorough knowledge of core concepts, design also requires the representation of concepts visually to make effective or functional communication and iteration of ideas. For creative skills and aesthetic sense, one must clearly understand the use of basic design elements and their applications for a particular design solution. For a designer to communicate more concisely and in a visually appropriate manner, it is necessary to use commonly understood principles, perspective and design layout standards. Together, these conventions constitute a visual language, and help to ensure that the drawing is clear and relatively easy to understand. VISUAL COMMUNICATION: The concept and science of Visual Communication is introduced as the relationship between human information processing, with emphasis on processing of visual information and design of messages. It includes visual perception, Gestalt laws of organization, semantics, working memory (STM & LTM) and their implications on.
The course also introduces students to the fundamentals of Typography and Photography. The Typography course introduces students to the fundamentals of Typography and its application in effective product interface/communication. And the Photography course introduces the students to photography as a medium of visual language and applies it to visual design. In today’s world that is crowded with visual stimulus it is important to cut through the noise and be able to decipher, capture and create visual images that communicate.",,,,,,,,,
Parallel Runtimes for Modern Processors,CSE513,"Computing hardware is becoming more and more complex. Today and in the foreseeable future, performance will be delivered principally by increased hardware parallelism. Modern multicore processors scale to over one hundred cores, have wide vector units, maintain a complex memory hierarchy and even share the memory with accelerators such as GPU. Conventional programming models using threads impose significant complexity to organize code into multiple threads of control and balance work amongst threads to ensure proper utilization of computing resources. This shortcoming has helped the advent of parallel runtimes that assist the programmer by efficiently scheduling the parallel tasks over available resources. This course introduces the design and implementation of such a parallel runtime and explores the challenges in achieving performance and energy efficiency over modern processors.",,,,,,,,,

Non-Classical Logics,MTH504A,"This course aims to draw attention to logical systems that are different from classical or standard mathematical logic. Classical logic has been very successful in various ways, not the least of which is in being able to provide a firm foundation for mathematics. Despite this, many of the interesting developments in logic in the past few decades, especially in philosophy and computer science, have occurred in areas such as intuitionism, paraconsistent logics, modal and temporal logics, quantum logic, fuzzy logic, and so on. These are all logics which are intended either to supplement classical logic, or else to replace it where it doesn’t fit. Such logics are grouped together under the umbrella term ‘non-classical logics’. In this course, we will cover some of these systems restricting ourselves only to the propositional cases. We will also give an introduction to analytic tableaus, which have gained popularity as a decision procedure among logicians and computer scientists. The subject could be of interest to students in both Mathematics and Computer Science. The topics covered will include a very brief review of classical propositional logic, semantic tableaus, basic modal logic, intuitionistic logic, paraconsistent and many-valued logics.",,,,,,,,,
Lattices in Computer Science,CSE526,"A lattice is a dicrete addtive sub-group of an n-dimensional Euclidean space. Lattices have been extensively studied both in computer science and mathematics.

This course will focus on first building some basic backgroud on n-dimensional Euclidean lattices. This will be followed up by discussing some (believed to be) hard problems on lattices and their associated complexity results. This will be followed by looking at some applications of lattices in areas like combinatorial optimizations (the integer programming problem), number theory and cryptanalysis. Finally we will look at how the lattice-based hardness assumptions can be used to build cryptographic protocols that are secure against quantum adversaries. In particular we will end the course by looking at Regev’s polytime quantum reduction from (worst-case) approximate SIVP to (average-case) LWE.",,,,,,,,,

It will also develop skills to analyze and critique existing systems and understand ways by which some of these systems may be violating some of the fundamental usability principles and what can be done to fix it.",,,,,,,,,
Information Theory,ECE634,"Algorithms have always been designed to make communication systems, or for that matter any system, more reliable, less memory consuming, more efficient in using system resources, etc. This then begs the question, how does one know if an algorithm is optimal, i.e., whether it ensures the minimum possible usage of system resources in accomplishing its task? In other words, we want to ask, what are the fundamental limitations that a system and a given task imposes on all possible algorithms that can solve that given task?

One possible way to tackle such questions is through the discipline of information theory, and this course is meant as an intorduction to this field. The course will broadly cover three canonical systems: The lossless storage system requiring minimal storage space consumption with perfect recovery, the noisy communication channel requiring maximum communication rates for arbitrarily low probability of decoding error, and the lossy storage system requiring minimal storage space while allowing a pre-defined level of distortion in the recovered data. To tackle these three broad problems, we shall first introduce the fundamental information theoretic quantities such as entropy, relative entropy, mutual information, and study their properties. Next, we shall introduce various tools required for proofs such as asymptotic equipartition property, Fano's inequality, method of types, data processing inequality. Finally, the student will be introduced to the probabilistic method for obtaining proofs. We shall then leverage these proof techniqes to see how the fundamental limits of the above-mentioned systems can be expressed in terms of the quantities such as entropy, relative entropy, and mutual infomation.

Individual or groups of students (depending on the number of attendees) will be asked to choose and explore one further topic from a curated list of topics from areas such as network information theory, applications of information theory, information theoretic security, common information. The students would be required to prepare a report summarising their understanding of their chosen topic, as part of their evaluation.",,,,,,,,,

Foundations of Marketing,ENTxxx,"Why do we need to study about Marketing? In other words, does Marketing as a discipline really needs to be formally studied? In fact, as a discipline where does Marketing really stand at. Much like any social science discipline Marketing and its history remains evolutionary in nature. Even as sit down to write about the discipline there are changes that are happening inherently. However, much of the course and the history of it comes from Economics and the rules of it. Markets, Demand & Supply, Pricing, Competition and some more have their origins in both Economics and later Marketing also enveloped some of it. In the 80’s when the markets started opening up the new world of organised retailing and as RFID started seeping into retailing the whole texture of Marketing started to change. Consumer Behavior as a discipline emerged much more strongly and proactively, Marketing became more subjective in nature and less prone to assumptions. Simultaneously it was not only about demand generation and fulfilment. Context like impulse buying, shopping history and data driven marketing started doing the rounds. And as Digital started putting its footprint in the mid 2000’s the whole gamut of Marketing underwent massive changes.
The course targets the following objectives to be fulfilled:
1. Understanding how Marketing as a discipline has evolved
2. How Marketing is relevant to you in the current curriculum
3. Interpreting and evaluating cross disciplinary issues in Marketing from Operations, Finance and IT oriented perspective",,,,,,,,,
