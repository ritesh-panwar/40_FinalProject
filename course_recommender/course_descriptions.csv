It is the backbone of computer science and has a lot of applications in cryptography and engineering.
DES504,Narratives are used in design as a technique to get insight into users; build empathy and access them emotionally. With stories; designers speak to increase the appeal of what they offer and provide a solid understanding of the users. For eg.; UX designers typically tell on-screen stories; weaving narratives to make users invest their emotions in our messages. Designers aim to engage users through their feelings; as opposed to describing design of the product or system from a functionalist/task-oriented viewpoint. An effective user experience depends on the success of users’ achieving their goals ‘usability-wise’. However; storytelling is the framework used by designers to reach users. The world can be experienced through metaphors; not bullet-point specifications; storytelling is the best way to relate to audiences. Effective storytelling means going beyond getting users emotionally invested; to keeping them engaged after their experiences; too; so they attach more meaning to designed products/services.Sketching/Drawing is used as medium both to form a conceptual understanding and execution of narrative as a tool of communication. Sketching/Drawing in Visual Commuication is a fundamental tool for Narratives; which is not limited to using the analogus pencil on paper or the digital tablet and pen. It is an activity that involves observation; visualisation and storytelling.
DES101,DESIGN DRAWINGBased on the premise that drawing is central to the design process this course focuses on drawing as a medium for observing; representing; conceptualizing; visualizing and communicating design ideas. The emphasis is on drawing by hand; which is the most direct and intuitive means we have to express our visual thoughts and perceptions. In direct response to our visual thoughts and perceptions; we develop an understanding of spatial concepts and the critical ability to think and visualize in three dimensions through the tactile nature of drawing.This course fosters understanding of drawing and sketching as a means to develop observational skills through the study of the environment and as a tool for visual representation; ideation/conceptualization; visualization and communication or presentation of design ideas through sketching and drawing from both observation and memory.VISUALIZATION DRAWINGVisualization is an act of thought or reflection. In design; we speculate and visualize what might be possible in the future. Drawing gives material existence to our conceptions so that they can be seen; assessed; and acted upon. The drawing out of these ideas; whether executed quickly or slowly; roughly or carefully; is necessarily speculative in nature. We can never determine beforehand precisely what the final outcome will be. The developing image on paper gradually takes on a life of its own and guides the exploration of a concept as it travels between mind and paper and back again. Drawing from the imagination addresses issues that arise as we think in a speculative manner to stimulate the design process; develop our design ideas through drawing; and plan how to present our design proposals in the best possible light. This course gives the students an overview of the generative and developmental stages of the design process and drawing as distinctly speculative in nature. Thoughts develop as a drawing progress; which can alter perceptions and suggest possibilities not yet conceived.
DES201/DES501,This course introduces students to the theoretical and practical aspects of design evolving processes.

ECO324/524,The purpose of this course is to introduce the standard spatial- analytic framework for analyzing spatial data and its target audience are social scientists and engineers. In the past decade or so; much interest has grown in the area due to readily-available spatially-delineated data; particularly when in 2008 the U.S. Geological Survey stopped charging for its high-resolution LANDSAT archive. However; spatial data and spatial relationships necessitate the use of analytic tools beyond the standard statistical methods such as OLS. The role of spatial autocorrelation (also known as multidimensional autocorrelation) in spatial datasets is a focus of this course. In addition; we will ask: how and why does spatial autocorrelation arise; how is it measured and understood; how does it relate to issues of spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence; and how these factors inform the specification and estimation of regression models.Specific modeling techniques include spatial autocorrelation measures (Moran's I; Geary's C); spatial regression models.

DES303,You cannot be a good film maker if you don’t know how to edit audio sound track and video film footage. One of the worlds greatest film maker Eisenstein stated: "Cinematography is; first and foremost; montage." Eisenstein believed that film montage could create ideas or have an impact beyond the individual images. Two or more images edited together create a "tertium quid" (third thing) that makes the whole greater than the sum of its individual parts. Similarly Alfred Hitchcock said “For me; cinema is essentially emotion. It is pieces of film joined together that create an idea; which in turn creates an emotion in the mind of the audience. Not through spoken words; but through the visuals. It's a visual medium. And montage is the main thing. All moviemaking is pure montage." It is believed by some that good films are made more on the editing table.

The course will prepare the student to undertake a semester long or year lomg project in various application areas of fluid mechanics / computational fluid dynamics.
MTH512,An algebraic number field is a field obtained by adjoining to the rational numbers the roots of an irreducible rational polynomial. Algebraic number theory is the study of properies of such fields. This course will cover the following topics: number fields; rings of integers; factorization in Dedekind domains; class numbers and class groups; units in rings of integers ; valuations and local fields; and if time permits decomposition of primes; and zeta functions of number fields. These tools provide solutions to several problems which are elementary to state but surprisingly difficult to resolve; including Pell’s equation; quadratic reciprocity; the two squares theorem and the four squares theorem (every positive integer is a sum of four square integers).
MTH513,This course discusses factorization theory in integral domains; and basic properties of solvable groups; nilpotent groups and rings with chain conditions.This course also introduces Galois Theory; which was initiated by Galois in the 19th century. As applications of Galois Theory; solvability of polynomialsby radicals; and classical straightedge (ruler) and compass constructions will be discussed.
MTH514,This course deals with the design and study of error-detecting and error-correcting codes for the reliable transmission/storage of data over noisy communication channels.
MTH518,The aim of this course is to introduce various topics in Number Theory such as Farey fractions; continued fractions; partitions; quadratic forms and geometry of numbers.
MTH550,Partial differential equations are ubiquitous in the sciences and engineering. One encounters them in various contexts : from relatively simple and well studied scenarios such as modeling a vibrating string or membrane using the wave equation to problems as complicated as modeling fluid flows using the Navier Stokes equations : a system that is yet untractable analytically. The present course is an advanced undergraduate / introductory postgraduate course in the subject. It starts with a quick review of first order linear PDEs; classification of second order equations; initial and boundary conditions and the notion of well posed problems. The three most prominent linear PDEs: Wave; Heat and Laplace are then dealt with in detail. Convergence and completeness of Fourier series are studied before taking up a study of harmonic functions. This is followed by a detailed look at Green's identity and Green's functions. Distributions and transforms (Laplace and Fourier) are studied before ending the course with an introduction to nonlinear PDEs wherein we study shock waves and solitons; take a brief look at calculus of variations and bifurcation theory and take up an application to studying water waves.

PSY201,This course is about how and why people think; feel and behave. Students will learn and apply theories of self; mind; and behavior. This course is an experientialcourse. Students will learn to think more critically and scientifically about what makes people think; feel; and behave. This course offers students an engaging introduction to the essential topics in psychology. Throughout this study of human behavior and the mind; students will gain insight into the history of the field of psychology; as well as explore current theories and issues in areas such as cognition; motivation; and wellness. The main goals of this course are to acquaint students with different areas contained within psychology; to provide them with some of the major concepts of each area. Basic topics that would be covered would be historical and contemporary psychology; including various perspectives: biological; Psychoanalytic (Freudian); behavioral (Skinner; Pavlov; and other theories); humanistic; Jungian; cognitive; Transactional analysis. Some practical topics like Memory; Personality; cognition; Motivation; mindfulness; Cognitive behavior therapy and basics of positive psychology would also be covered. Students will also learn the concepts of Intelligence. Computational Psychology; Computational Neuroscience and Technological research in interventions would also be explored.
PSY202,“Happiness is not an end state; but rather something you work towards your whole life. Thus; you can be happier each day. Even happiness is a journey; not a destination.”- Martin SeligmanIn this course students will not only study but actually imbibe this journey.The mentioned course would be based on the key concepts of Positive Psychology; its principles; concepts and experiential practices. The course focuses on the psychological aspects of a fulfilling and flourishing life. Topics include happiness; self-esteem; empathy; friendship; love; achievement; creativity; optimism; conflict resolution; gratitude; positive leadership; hypnosis; mindfulness; meditation and humor.Positive psychology is “the scientific study of optimal human functioning” and was first introduced as a field of study by Dr. Martin Seligman in 1998; when he was President of the American Psychological Association.The underlying premise of positive psychology is that you can learn to be happier just as you can learn a foreign language or to be proficient at golf. This rapidly growing field is shedding light on what makes us happy; the pursuit of happiness; and how we can lead more fulfilling; satisfying lives. As Martin Seligman states that it is the Science of Positive Psychology that would help the individual to study the self and the society and to help him realize his maximum potential; with which he would be able to lead a happier personal; academic; social and professional life.This course is designed to explore the concepts; research behind the concepts; techniques; factors and exercises to enhance optimism; decrease stressors; and significantly increase wellbeing. The format of the course will be experiential; workshop based and interactive along with assigned lectures and readings to create an environment conducive to learning new concepts; skills and applications.
PSY301,In this introductory course we investigate the mechanisms of human thinking. Particularly we will explore the basic mental processes such as how our brains let us “view” and “understand” the world; how our perceptions depend on our current state of attention; and how our memories and perceptions can change over time with our own experiences. In this process of better understanding the human mind; we’ll discuss language abilities and the mental representation of concepts and schemas. We’ll also look at various actions that people take in different situations—from simple visual illusions; to strategic higher order decisions to grave mistakes in higher-level decision-making. In this context we will discuss how these “successes” and “failures” provide unique insights into the mechanisms of human thinking.

SOC202,This course will systematically familiarize students with some of the important vignettes of a complex and highly diverse country–India. Using a historically contextualized approach to understand the shaping of ‘contemporary’; this course will provide an overview of the functioning and transformation of India in the face of global social change. Grounded in sociology but drawing upon recent developments in the other social sciences as well; this course will critically examine the transformations in India’s social; cultural; political; economic and technological realms and will critically interrogate the developmental issues and fault lines facing Indian society both from the vantage point of contemporary and indigenous sociological theory.
SOC204,This course is aimed introducing students to macro-sociological concepts to understand the role of new media and online networking in the contemporary world. (In PART I) we draw from sociological perspectives that move beyond ‘technological determinism’ and shed light on the social and real-world implications of IT-driven media and communications. We begin with a survey of key concepts; including the theories of networks by Barry Wellman (2012); Manuel Castells (1996) and others who conceptualised the rise of ‘new’ media and online communicationsas as central to ongoing social change. (In PartII) We consider a series of thematic areas and evaluate these theories in the context of contemporary socieities. These themes range from the rising inequality and digital divide; to the role of new media in politics and power and also in the related fields of journalism and law. In terms of pedagogical approach; and evaluating criteria; our course will rely on active learning that requires all students to participate and engage with online communities as well as reflect on the key concepts through their own experience as social media users in India.
SOC205,When we hear the words 'social media' we immediately think of Facebook and Twitter; WhatsApp and Instagram. But these are just platforms. Actually; Social media is the vast amount of content we have produced and its consequences for our lives. The content we produce are not just memes and selfies alone; but they are also tools for making and breaking relationships; a means for creating equality and/or reinforcing inequality. While there have been grand claims made about how social media has impacted the lives of people around the world; we often fail to ask is it really likely that social media has changed the life of a low-income builder in Brazil in exactly the same way as it has for an IT professional in South India or that of a factory worker in China? Consider this claim... social media is a sort of big brother that knows all our intimate details and we have lost our rights to privacy. While it is true for some; it is equally true that social media is also the first-time people experience privacy. For e.g. In China; for some people far from being a threat to their privacy; social media was actually the very first time they had experienced what we would call individual privacy. This was true in Turkey as well. Similarly; while it is true that while some might view social media as a distraction to education; itis equally true that for a few others social media is itself education. Likewise; for some the Selfie is more about expressing friendship rather than individual glamour; thus subverting the notion of individualism. How do we know this? Why do people see the same phenomenon differently? While it is important to understand ‘what’ content we produce; the question of why we produce such content is equally significant. This course meant as an introductory course is about ‘people’ and an attempt at understanding the affinities; connectedness; and reciprocities that social media builds. The course will also introduce ethnographic ways and means to study works of anthropologically informed social media cultures. The course would also focus on ontologies of media anthropology and specific texts that are produced through online ethnographies This course invites you to come and see for yourselves what people around the world do with social media.
SOC206,How did experiences of sleeping in strangers’ homes lead to the creation of one of the world’s most successful online hospitality company - Airbnb? How did the idea of public space influence and lead to the creation of the world’s most successful coffee company - Starbucks? How does Youtube; the most significant pool of social and cultural data since the beginning of recorded communication use it to reveal more about us; humans and the society we live?Why do people buy what they buy? Do Malls have a hold on the consumers? Does Coca-Cola have the same meaning in all cultures? How does advertising influence your decision to buy? Do people buy products which speak to their cultural values? How is culture tied to consumption? How do companies mine your social media and online data for understanding your consumption patterns?Does Wall Street have its own culture? How does working in virtual teams affect the work culture and productivity of people? How do employees make use of organizational technology to shape Organizational culture? Does the idea of ‘Tribal Leadership’ by Zappos founder Tony Hsieh influence employees?All the above factors have cultural influences more than what we tend to acknowledge. In the recent past corporations have started using ethnography and anthropology to gain insights into marketing and organizations strategically. Exploring and deconstructing such cultural and social influences through both fieldwork and case studies (text and videos) with a sprinkling of anthropological theories is the primary intent of this course.
SOC208,
SOC209,Rising consumption levels is a key aspect of contemporary societies. “We live in a consumer society” is a phrase we come across very often. This statement points towards the disproportionate significance of material possessions; consumer goods and services in modern societies and the power of money to “buy it all”. Right from the food we eat; the clothes we wear; the cars we drive; the media we consume; the technologies we use and the health and educational services we get; consumption pervades our everyday lives and practices. Is shopping only a frivolous activity? Do people claim identities through commodities? What is modern consumption based on- needs or wants? The course on Consumer Culture and Society will make students re-think of themselves less as citizens and more as consumers. Emphasis in this course will be on understanding consumption practices by embedding them within their social; cultural; and economic contexts. Both the positive and negative impacts of consumerism on individuals and societies will be interrogated. Lectures will be complimented through field-based activities where students will examine consumption places and spaces (shopping malls; local markets; advertisements and e-stores) to understand what all (in addition to the actual product) is being sold – an image; a lifestyle; a status symbol; a body type; modernity etc.. Using specific consumption domains like food; fashion; media/entertainment technology and intimate relations the course will make the learners engage with ideas of liberation; choice; identity; status; inequality; lifestyle; freedom; signification; and power. Further; critiques of consumerism and their linkages with ‘big issues’ of consumer protests and environmental degradation will also be discussed.
SOC210,Sociology is a fundamental social science that builds an understanding of the dynamics of an increasingly complex world. As a discipline it fosters an understanding not merely of the social element of human life but of how economic; social and political arrangements intersect to create and transform institutions; groups and communities of which we are a part. To that end a fundamental course in Sociological Theory will build an understanding on some of the big questions we confront today- globalisation; the entrenchement of information technology in our lives ; the rise of social inequalities and an increased concern for the environment.The course will do this by turning to classical sociological theories that offer us an ‘epic theory’ to understand the development of the modern world. The second half of the course will focus on contemporary issues and theories tracing their links to and away from the classical approaches. A study of theory of theory will allow students to critically analyse the development of values and institutions that have been the foundation of modern society both in India and across the world.
SOC312,This course introduces students to the sociology of science and technology (STS). It engages with ideas that question pure science as value-neutral theory that hold the potential to reveal an existing empirical reality. This idea further destablises the distinction between science as theory and technology as its application; by exploring the various methods through which science and technology construct truths about the world. The course asks a crucial and fundamental question— what is science and technology? Is science the theory of the natural world and technology the material artefact that emerges through scientific principles? Or are science and technology embedded in webs of social relations? Or are science and technology developed through the values that drive it: including ideas of growth; development; efficiency; reducing human labour and conquering the natural world.The course will study science; technology and society as continuous domains; which will allow students to explore different perspectives on science that question the taken for granted-ness of reality; by paying attention to the social processes of knowledge making. Further the course will encourage students to study the social circumstances of developing newer technologies by thinking about the use and effect of technology on society. This will promote critical thinking about technology: how are technologies compatible with particular political systems; what are its effects on existing power structures; how does it relate to systems of governing; and finally how does it impact ecology or raise concerns of sustainability.While the course does not focus on a particular technology; because it is explores more fundamental ideas of technology and its relation to science and society; the tutorials and evaluation will be based on case studies from Biotechnology; Nanotechnology; Robotics; Cognitive Sciences and Artificial Intelligence. In examining case studies of these technologies; the course will introduce students to criteria for understanding and evaluating the above technologies. In doing so; sociological perspectives are brought to the study of science and technology; in order to question the conceptual divide between science as theory; technology as its application and society as unrelated to them.
SOC 212,Traditional economic analysis takes the rational individual as its starting point. Economic Sociology on the other hand encourages students to see rational self-interest and action as embedded in society; influenced by group dynamics; legal institutions; power; organizations and even culture. It justifies the application of independent sociological methods and concepts to the examination and understanding of the Economy as a sphere of production; consumption and exchange of goods and services; which is observable in all human societies; not only the modern and advanced. It thereby encourages students to relate economic actions to all other forms of social actions observable in society – the religious; the familial; the technological and the political. In sum; Economic sociology identifies the obligatory; symbolic and power seeking motivations underlying human economic action; not only the useful or utilitarian.Thic Course provides students with a corrective perspective. It re-ignites awareness of fundamental questions and looks to the contributions of thinkers like Karl Polanyi; Marcell Mauss and Granovetter and Swedberg to reconsider our assumptions on how we produce;consume and exchange; and live.
SOC302,What is a city? Why is technological advancement/innovation associated with cities? Who belongs to a city? How is a city different from a countryside? Why is urban life coveted? Does Paris in France have an old city area like many Indian cities have? What makes each city different yet similar? Is everyone’s experience of living in the city the same? Urban Sociology studies the relationship between city; its institutions; its space and its people. Over the course of this semester; this course will look at (i) cities; their origin and evolution; (ii) the nature and character of cities (iii) how technology has shaped urban landscape and urban social relations; (iv) conflicts and contestations that characterise life in city; and (v) the future of cities in a digital; global age.The course will familiarise students with the macro and micro forces shaping the urban landscape and social relations. The course through a combination of lectures; case studies and activities will highlight challenges and opportunities associated with cities in a bid to encourage application of students’ technological knowledge in a sociologically relevant and socially viable manner to address urban phenomena and urban challenges. The course will broadly cover themes like urbanism; urbanisation; suburbanisation; peri-urbanisation; gentrification; slums; urban villages; segregation and inequality; right to the city; smart cities; digital technology and cities. At the culmination of this course students will broadly be familiar with ideas and debates in urban sociology.
SOC307,With the digital social data growing at an accelerated pace on an everyday basis; there is an urgent need for social researchers to decrypt; examine and interpret this unusually large-scale complex data fill. Doing this systemically will not only help in deciphering and understanding the social world we live in but will also help strategically combat the complex challenges of the contemporary social world. With a growing demand for such skills both in the academic and the commercial sectors; this course anchored in sociology and anthropology will provide the learners to a methodological rigour steeped in theoretical underpinnings from both these fields. Through empirical approaches suited specifically for the digital data; this course will provide the learners an opportunity to effectively engage not only in identifying interesting issues to study; but also with framing valid research questions; formulating an effective research design; sampling; data collection methods and tools; quantitative/qualitative and mixed methods analyses of the collected data and the necessary theoretical interpretation of the results. The course also aims to provide its learners an objective view of social data issues viz. reliability; replicability; reproducibility; validity and generalizability of the data and the associated methods. It will also introduce the learners to ethical implications associated with conducting digital social research.

SSH101,This course offers an introduction to ideas about reasoning and elements of thinking critically. In particular; it develops an appreciation of the relevance of reasoning and ideation in the realm of the social sciences. It includes an introduction to key elements and concepts of reasoning and informal logic as well as an applied component which uncovers the value of critical thinking involved in social theory building. In the first part of the course; students will learn about types and nature of good and bad arguments. They 'll be able to differentiate and evaluate the logic in deductive arguments and understand key concepts of validity and soundness. Similarly; students will also be introduced to ideas in inductive thinking and to ways in which one can spot fallacies and other common mistakes. In addition; this course also introduces students; many of whom will be handling social science data for the first time; to the role of critical thinking in social theory development; including in making observations; developing concepts as well as in coming up with explanations that form the basis for doing modern social sciences. The course ends with an exposition on the role of computational power and its implications for values in an era of big data.
SSH124,This course introduces the learner to the fundamentals of critical thinking and informal logic. We will use a ‘mixed’ instructional methodology that includes lecture; Q&A; learning team activities; discussion of videos; slides; print articles and the text.
SSH201,The Social Sciences Research Methods course will focus on providing an introduction and a broad overview of how Social Researchers namely Economists; Anthropologists; Psychologists and Sociologists ask and answer questions through rigorous research methodologies. The course will not only provide an overview of identifying social problems and formulating research questions but will also introduce learners to framing their research design; collecting social data; techniques of data analyses and interpretation of results through a systematic research paradigm. In order to accomplish this; the course is designed to offer learners an assortment of quantitative and qualitative methods. The course will concurrently use quantitative; qualitative and other specialised software to analyse real social data that is either publicly available or has been collected by our faculty members. This class would use a combination of in-class lectures and lab sessions to help students complement their theoretical knowledge with hands on experience with dealing with datasets; data analysis software; and data analytical techniques.
SSH211,Studying Theories propounded by Masters of Theatre and their lives and influences. The course is designed not only to give a theoretical appreciation of theatre but it will be largely interspersed with class room improvisations and voice and movement exercises so that the students have a hands-on understanding right from the start

To sensitise students to some of the important common social issues which writers of different backgrounds; cultures; and mediums have examined.
SSH215,This course introduces students to the literature of India. It surveys a selection of literary works by authors in India and in the diaspora. The course will examine how key cultural concepts have reappeared across Indian literary traditions over time and how they have been reimaginedwithin the context of specific historical junctures and socio-linguistic networks. It shall focus on themes such as idea of home and territories; women and notion of the body; borders and conflict; power and politics; problems of translation; and the intersections between ideas of real and imagined geographies that constitute the dynamics of the Indian literary scape. In studying some specific sections; there will be the comparative study of constructions of themes in cinematic productions.The idea is to include the discursive; alternate versions of the thematic narration and the kinds of discordant identities they imagine and manoeuvre from the text or screen to the layers of socio-cultural literary articulation.
SSH216,The primary aim of this course is to introduce students to vast; deep and rich world of Indian mythology. The course will seek to build a generic understanding of the Indian system of thought; with focus on stories as means of unravelling truth and building perspective.

MTH544,This an introductory course on smooth differential forms on smooth manifolds. It willattempt to serve as a sequel to abstracting calculus beyond real and multivariableanalysis to higher dimensional vector spaces and manifolds. The primary emphasis willbe on understanding calculus in R^n to begin with; first for n = 3; and then moregenerally via differential forms. The course also has an applied theme and will concludewith three different applications of concepts: to engineering via optimization onmanifolds; to mathematics via de Rham cohomology of manifolds; and to physics viamodeling of Maxwell’s equations.We shall review basic concepts from multivariable calculus; linear algebra; algebra;geometry and topology first as well as intersperse them later as and when needed.Initially; this shall include geometry in linear algebra; partial and directional derivatives;multiple integrals; alternating multilinear algebra; parametric curves and surfaces; andtangent vectors and spaces. Next; we shall introduce differential forms via integration;the exterior derivative; wedge product of forms; and properties of differential forms inR^n. This will be followed by a quick discussion of Riemannian metric; the Hodge starmap; and inner product of differential forms in this context. Discussion of Stoke’stheorem; an introduction to smooth manifolds; notion of vector fields; push forward andpullback maps will form the last conceptual module. In the end; we will discuss threeapplications; namely computational methods for linear optimization on manifolds withgeometric constraints; de Rham cohomology of manifolds; and differential formsmodeling of Maxwell’s equations.
